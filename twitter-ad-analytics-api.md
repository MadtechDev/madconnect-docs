![](<.gitbook/assets/image (17).png>)

Twitter, recently renamed X, is a popular social media platform that allows users to post and interact with short messages, known as "tweets." These tweets are limited to 280 characters and can include text, images, videos, and links. Users can follow other accounts to see their tweets in their timeline, and they can engage with tweets by liking, retweeting, or replying to them.

Analytics metrics help partners and advertisers understand the performance of the content they promote on Twitter. This includes information such as impressions, clicks, video views, and spend. In addition, partners and advertisers are able to get detailed metrics for various segments of the audiences they reach.

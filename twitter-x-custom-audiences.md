![](<.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>)

Twitter, recently renamed X, is a popular social media platform that allows users to post and interact with short messages, known as "tweets." These tweets are limited to 280 characters and can include text, images, videos, and links. Users can follow other accounts to see their tweets in their timeline, and they can engage with tweets by liking, retweeting, or replying to them.

Twitter Custom Audiences API enhances ad targeting precision by allowing seamless integration of custom audience data. Advertisers can optimize campaigns with tailored messaging, ensuring more effective engagement and improved ROI on the Twitter platform.

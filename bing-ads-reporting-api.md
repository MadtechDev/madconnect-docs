Bing Ads enables conducting PPC campaigns in the Bing search engine. Bing Ads can run search network campaigns (text and dynamic ads), product campaigns for some countries, and campaigns promoting mobile apps. In campaigns, you can use location targeting, links, images, applications, reviews, and call extensions. Bing uses artificial intelligence to better optimize campaigns.

The reporting service provides reports that you can use to track finances, measure ad performance, and adjust settings to optimize your budget or campaign.

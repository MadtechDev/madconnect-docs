LinkedIn enables businesses to target their audiences using accurate, profile-based first-party data, to reach a highly engaged audience with native ads in a professional feed across desktop and mobile. The platform enables businesses to create, measure, and optimize campaigns all in one place, and drive leads, build brand awareness, and nurture key relationships at every stage of your sales cycle.

LinkedIn Conversions API creates a direct connection between marketing data from an advertiserâ€™s server and LinkedIn. This enables advertisers to measure the performance of their LinkedIn marketing campaigns no matter where the conversion happens and use this data to power campaign optimization. Conversions API can help strengthen performance and decrease cost per action with more complete attribution, improved data reliability, and better optimized delivery. Refer to LinkedIn Conversions API for more information.

Twitter, recently renamed X, is a popular social media platform that allows users to post and interact with short messages, known as "tweets." These tweets are limited to 280 characters and can include text, images, videos, and links. Users can follow other accounts to see their tweets in their timeline, and they can engage with tweets by liking, retweeting, or replying to them.

Programatically schedule campaigns and manage ads on Twitter through this suite of APIs.

Pinterest is a social media platform that focuses on visual content and discovery. It allows users to discover and save ideas for various interests by creating and organizing virtual pinboards. Users can browse through images, known as "pins," which can include photos, recipes, DIY projects, fashion ideas, and more.

Pinterest is often used for inspiration and planning in areas such as home decor, fashion, cooking, travel, and more. It's a platform where users curate their interests visually and share them with others.

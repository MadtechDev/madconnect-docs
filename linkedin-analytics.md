LinkedIn enables businesses to target their audiences using accurate, profile-based first-party data, to reach a highly engaged audience with native ads in a professional feed across desktop and mobile. The platform enables businesses to create, measure, and optimize campaigns all in one place, and drive leads, build brand awareness, and nurture key relationships at every stage of your sales cycle.

## Analytics API

The LinkedIn Reporting APIs provide key insights on performance such as clicks, impressions, and ad spend, and demographics information such as metrics by demographic values at the account, campaign, and creative levels. These insights help your users make the most of their LinkedIn ads experience and ensure that their campaigns are performing effectively.

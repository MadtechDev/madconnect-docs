![](<.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

Snapchat is a multimedia messaging app that revolutionized visual communication. Renowned for its ephemeral content and innovative features like Stories and Lenses, Snapchat connects people through real-time, creative interactions, reshaping how users share moments and engage with multimedia content.

Snap’s Conversions API (CAPI) is a structured, privacy-centric interface that allows you to directly pass web, app, and offline events to Snap via a Server-to-Server (S2S) integration. This helps our system to optimize your ad campaigns, improve your targeting and measure the conversions that resulted from your Snapchat campaigns.  Server events behave similarly to events sent via other solutions, like Snap Pixel (SDK) or Mobile Measurement Partners (MMPs).

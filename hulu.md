Hulu is a subscription-based streaming service that offers a variety of on-demand content, including TV shows, movies, and original programming. It is a joint venture between The Walt Disney Company, 21st Century Fox (now part of The Walt Disney Company), Comcast (now also part of The Walt Disney Company), and Time Warner (now WarnerMedia).

Hulu doesn't publicly provide an API for developers. They have an internal API essential for their services, but the company has decided not to offer it to developers.

**Connection Type:** Source and Destination.

Currently, no API is available for Hulu. You will need batch upload data into the platform.

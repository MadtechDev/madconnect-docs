Pandora is a subscription-based music streaming service owned by the broadcasting corporation Sirius XM Holdings.

The Pandora developer portal is a platform which contains all the necessary documentation, tools, and services needed to get an approved developer set up to start building their app, interacting with Pandoraâ€™s rich resources of music and metadata by employing an exciting array of API services.

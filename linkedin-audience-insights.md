LinkedIn enables businesses to target their audiences using accurate, profile-based first-party data, to reach a highly engaged audience with native ads in a professional feed across desktop and mobile. The platform enables businesses to create, measure, and optimize campaigns all in one place, and drive leads, build brand awareness, and nurture key relationships at every stage of your sales cycle.

## Audience Insights API

Audience Insights API enables you to discover and identify the audience segments that meet your target persona, demonstrate interest and engagement in relevant customer products/offerings, uncover insights about the companies the target audience works for, and activate audience for targeting in sponsored ad campaigns on LinkedIn. This enables advertisers to use LinkedIn data and insights as a part of their broader audience discovery, planning, activation and optimization processes by delivering on the “Audience first” approach.
